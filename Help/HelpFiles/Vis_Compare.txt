Visualization -> Compare Light Sources

This programs allows the user to compare any two light sources by displaying the Colour Rendering Index metric's 14 test colour samples (and two artificial grays) as they would look under the selected light source.

The only parameters that the user needs to enter are:

Gamma - This value is unique to the monitor that is being used to run this program and the lighting conditions of the room. If the user does not know this number it is safe to use a value between 2.0 and 2.5. The lower the ambient illumination, the lower the gamma should be.

K1 - This is the gain constant to be used. As with Gamma, if the user does not know the value, it is recommended to use a number between 1.0 and 1.3.

Colour Multiplier - If, for some reason, the user wants to increase the brightness of the resulting colour samples, it is possible to do so by increasing the colour multiplier.

Custom SPD - This allows the user to load a custom SPD file. Once a file has been chosen, it will display the resulting CRI/CQS colour samples as they would look like under the custom light source.

Save to Optimized LEDs - This will save the loaded custom SPD to the 'Optimized LEDs' section of the listboxes to use in the future without the need to load the SPD again.

CRI/CQS buttons - This allows the user to change the colour metric that the colour samples will be rendered in.

1nm/5nm buttons - Allows the user to load either 1nm or 5nm SPDs into the program. Currently only CIE Illuminant A and D65 is available for comparison.

Plot SPD - When pressed, the program plots the currently selected light source's SPDs on a single plot for comparison and analysis.

Plot TCS - When pressed, this plots the currently selected colour metric's(CRI/CQS) colour samples' spectral reflectance curves.

Analyse - When pressed, this shows the difference between the selected light sources' parameters.
