Calculation -> CRI

Using the Colour Rendering Index method - this program calculates the following paramters when a spectral power distribution file of any light source is loaded:

-Correlated Colour Temperature
-Luminous Efficacy
-Ra (General CRI)
-Rb (Secondary CRI value)
-Rc (Tertiary CRI value)
-R1-R14 (CRI value for each of the 14 colour samples)

It also plots the spectral reflectance curves of the 14 CRI colour samples as well as the SPD of the selected light source.
