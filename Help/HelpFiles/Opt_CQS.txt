Optimization -> CQS

Using differential evolution, this program can optimize the intensities of multiple LED spectral power distributions, to find the best combintaion of the given LEDs. It then plots the resultant SPD, displays relevant CQS parameters and saves the SPD parameters to a selected text file.
The parameters that are needed are explained below:

Generations - This value indicates how many generations the differntial evolution will have. The more generations, the better the result.

Population - This value indicates what the popuation of any particular generation will be. This value is automatically optimized depending on the number of SPDs loaded.

F - The mutation constant. This value is used to make sure the offspring are not identical to their parents.

CR - The crossover constant. This value influences the number of offspring vector elements to be changed.

Score Co-Efficients - These values are used to manipulate the differential evolution process to optimize towards a more specific goal. e.g. If Qa has a higher coefficient the proram will make getting a high Qa its priority.
